Description: ====================
        Tribe-Client
        ====================
        
        Tribe-client is a portable Python app to connect your bioinformatics server
        or tool to the 'Tribe' web service (located at https://tribe.greenelab.com).
        
        This package allows web servers created using
        `Django <https://docs.djangoprojects.com/en/dev/>`_ to connect directly
        to Tribe and make use of its resources. Users of the client web server or tool
        can access their Tribe resources via Tribe `OAuth2 <http://oauth.net/2/>`_
        authentication.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        If you are using tribe-client in a web server that uses Django, we recommend
        you use Django version 1.8 or newer.
        
        
        Download and Install
        ---------------------
        Tribe-client is registered as "tribe-client" in PyPI and is pip
        installable:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
        	pip install tribe-client
        
        
        
        Quick Start with Django
        ------------------------
        
        
        1. Add ``tribe_client`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'tribe_client',
            )
        
        
        2. Include the tribe-client URLconf in your project's URLconf (usually
        ``urls.py``):
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.conf.urls import url, patterns, include
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
              ...
              (r'^tribe_client/', include('tribe_client.urls')),
            )
        
        
        3. Register your client server at
        https://tribe.greenelab.com/oauth2/applications/. Make sure to:
        
          a. Be logged-in using your Tribe account
          b. Select "Confidential" under ``Client type`` and
          c. Select "Authorization Code" under ``Authorization grant type``
          d. Enter your client server's address plus "/tribe_client/get_token" in the ``Redirect uris`` box. If your client server's current address is http://example.com, enter **http://example.com/tribe_client/get_token**
        
          .. note:: Currently, Tribe supports the following ``Authorization grant types``:
        
              * Authorization code
              * Resource owner password-based
        
            and does not support the following:
        
              * Implicit
              * Client credentials
        
        
        4. Write down the Client ID in the ``TRIBE_ID`` setting and the Client secret
        in the ``TRIBE_SECRET`` setting in your ``settings.py`` file like so:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_ID = '*****Tribe Client ID*****'
            TRIBE_SECRET = '*****Tribe Client Secret*****'
        
        
        5. The ``TRIBE_REDIRECT_URI`` setting should be the address of the client
        server plus "/tribe_client/get_token".
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://example.com/tribe_client/get_token'
        
        
        6. Define in your settings the scope that your client server should have
        for Tribe resources. The two options are: 'read' and 'write'.The default
        is 'read'. **Note:** The 'write' scope includes the 'read' scope access. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_SCOPE = 'write'  # Or 'read'
        
        
        7. (Optional) If you want to use tribe_client's templates, make sure you have
        a base template (which gets extended by your other templates and contains
        the ``{% block content %}   {% endblock %}`` statements) that the tribe_client
        templates can extend, and specify its name in your settings. The name of this
        setting is ``TRIBE_CLIENT_BASE_TEMPLATE``. By default, tribe_client will
        look for a template called ``base.html``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_CLIENT_BASE_TEMPLATE = 'name_of_your_main_template.html'
        
        
        8. (Optional) If you want to use tribe_client's built-in login templates and
        urls, make a link that takes the user to the ``connect_to_tribe`` url in your
        website. This url will show users the built-in Tribe login page.
        Below is an example of this type of link in the webpage's navbar:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
              <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                <li><a href="{% url "connect_to_tribe" %}">Login with Tribe</a></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
        
        
        9. (Optional) If you want to redirect your users to somewhere other than
        the ``/tribe_client/display_genesets`` url after they have logged in,
        you can define this in the ``TRIBE_LOGIN_REDIRECT`` setting in your
        ``settings.py`` file. **Note:** If you are not using the tribe-client
        built-in templates (see above), you will need to define this setting so
        your users have somewhere to go after they log in.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_LOGIN_REDIRECT = '/place-to-go-after-login'
        
        
        10. (Optional) If you want to redirect your users to somewhere other than
        the ``/tribe_client`` url after they log out, you can define this in the
        ``TRIBE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT`` setting in your ``settings.py`` file.
        **Note:** If you are not using the tribe-client built-in templates (see above),
        you will need to define this setting so your users have somewhere to go after
        they log out.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            TRIBE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT = '/place-to-go-after-logout'
        
        
        11. (Optional) If you want to download and pickle gene sets/collections from
        Tribe by using the ``tribe_client_pickle_public_genesets`` management command,
        you must customize the following setting in ``settings.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            # Location of folder where pickled gene set files will be saved to.
            # This can be a subdirectory in your server's path (as shown here),
            # or not.
            PUBLIC_GENESET_FOLDER = os.path.join(
                <server directory>, <folder for pickled gene sets files>)
        
        
        and run the following management command: 
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            python manage.py tribe_client_pickle_public_genesets
        
        
        This will download and pickle all the public Tribe collections for every
        organism in your database. This is handy in case you want to do many gene
        set enrichment analyses across thousands of gene sets saved in Tribe, or any
        other task that would require making frequent, large, time-consuming requests
        for gene sets.
        
        
        A Closer Look
        -----------------------------
        
        Under the hood, tribe-client has functions that:
        
        1) Get an access token (via the `OAuth2 <http://oauth.net/2/>`_ protocol) that
        allows users to access and create resources in Tribe.
        
        2) Retrieves public and private collections (and their versions) and displays
        them on the client server using views and templates included in the package.
        
        3) Allows users to create new collections and versions remotely, from the
        client server.
